Please do not report any bugs. This is only a **Hello World** project for using
*tKinter*, not some project intended to actually do something. Bugs are abundant
and risky for daily use, **beaware**.

Thanks to @xmcp for **PYTHONIFYING** the code as I was a former and present C++
programmer. Yet the pythonified code could be seriously buggy, as it had been
tested by neither of us. Consider reverting to previous versions for stable
version.
